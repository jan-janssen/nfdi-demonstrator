# NFDI Demonstrator

![demo](demo.gif)

This repository contains a demonstrator for NFDI-Matwerk by the Heisenberg Professorship Data Analytics in Engineering at the University of Stuttgart.

While it is assumed in many applications that components are characterized by a homogeneous microstructure, this is not always the case.
In fact, materials often exhibit heterogeneities, which can affect the material behavior drastically.
In computational homogenization, the overall goal is to use numerical simulations to determine the effective material behavior of a heterogeneous material based on a given microstructure.

This demonstrator showcases a thermal homogenization problem of a 2D microstructure.
An interactive widget allows the user to play around with different parameters of the homogenization problem and solves it in near real-time (<10ms on state-of-the-art GPUs) to observe their implications.
Behind the scenes, a high-fidelity simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM) on a 400x400 grid (given directly by the microstructure image) is carried out with a GPU-accelerated implementation of our *FANS-CG* solver that features a special FFT-based preconditioner tailored to this problem.

In addition to the high-fidelity simulation, this demonstrator showcases a physics-augmented machine-learned surrogate model.
Rather than inputting the microstructure images directly into the neural network, each microstructure is characterized by 51 geometric descriptors, designed to capture essential morphological features.
Our novel surrogate model (Voigt-Reuss-Net) takes computed microstructure features as input and predicts the effective thermal conductivity tensor $\overline{\boldsymbol{\kappa}}$.
It provides a fast alternative to running full-field simulations, delivering instant predictions while maintaining physical admissibility by design.
The model ensures that predicted conductivities always lie within theoretical Voigt-Reuss bounds and satisfy material symmetry requirements.

## How to get started

While this demonstrator is meant to run on a GPU (ideally recent NVIDIA architecture), it can also run on the CPU (but slower).

### Manual installation

1. Install dependencies

- This demonstrator requires a Python installation with version >=3.11. The Python version can be changed, e.g., using [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
- Since this demonstrator is based on PyTorch, the prerequisites on <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/> apply.
- Optional: To compile the PyTorch model, a C++ compiler is required. On Ubuntu, the `build-essential` package is enough.

2. Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/DataAnalyticsEngineering/nfdi-demonstrator.git
cd nfdi-demonstrator
```

3. Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)

```
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies in virtual environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Start Jupyter Lab server:

```
jupyter lab
```

### Docker container

We provide a Docker image based on NVIDIA's PyTorch image that runs our demonstrator out of the box:

```
docker run -it --gpus all --ipc=host --net=host unistuttgartdae/nfdi-demonstrator
```

Or clone the repository and start the container automatically using `docker compose`:

```
git clone https://github.com/DataAnalyticsEngineering/nfdi-demonstrator.git
cd nfdi-demonstrator
docker compose up
```

Note that the underlying the base image by NVIDIA is rather large in size.
